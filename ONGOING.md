# ONGOING

## Code NB

- Test custom show defined in utils (for mime)
- Test autofig etc
- add serialization using JSON3 (Notebook -> Json and load from Json)

Note: when using `clear` the cache should be removed as well otherwise it might point to assets that don't exist anymore. Otherwise we assume that the assets are not removed by the user (...).

- Test stale notebook stuff
