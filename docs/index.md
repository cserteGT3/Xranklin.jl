## todo

- order of execution (first pass, then second pass resolving html stuff, and so should be careful)
- each page is two notebook (one for vars, one for code) + link to it from syntax. Notion of context (this is a bit advanced so maybe vars+funs should be intro and context more advanced with notebook stuff and cycles and shit)
