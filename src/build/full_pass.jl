full pass can be triggered by

1. initial pass
    1.a without cache
    1.b with cache
2. change of layout file(s)
3. config file changed
4. utils file changed

In the full pass, there are two phases that must happen in sequence
though internally each phase can happen in parallel.

Phase A (all pages) [case 1, 3, 4]

    - build page content (MD -> HTML_1) ignoring layout and {{...}}

Phase B (all pages) [all cases]
    - HTML1 -> HTML2

NOTE on assumptions

    * at most depth 1, meaning that a page A can request a variable from
        page B through a {{...}} call BUT that variable on page B cannot
        itself be requested from another page.
        So A <- B is allowed but not A <- B <- C (or deeper).

"""
    full_pass(watched_files; kw...)

[internal] perform a full pass over a set of watched files: each of these is
then processed in the `gc` context.

This can happen in the following situations (see `build_loop`)

1. the initial start of the server (GC is fresh)
2. layout HTML file was changed (e.g. '_layout/head.html')
3. config file was changed
4. utils file was changed

In case (4), the GC is reinstantiated so that all children contexts get
re-instantiated from scratch, reloading Utils at the start.
This is important since any code cell might call from Utils and we don't know
which ones do.

                        the initial pass, if the config is different than
                        a potential cached config file)
